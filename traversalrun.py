# Shortest Path Using Breadth-First Traversal.
# Using networkx to reveal all the shortest paths between two cities.
# Traversing the graph using the breadth-first approach will produce a path guaranteed to have the fewest nodes. 
# There are two such shortest paths between Aberdeen and Perth when you disregard the road distances.
